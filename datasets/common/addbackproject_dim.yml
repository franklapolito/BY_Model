  In accounting, an addback is an expense that is added back to a company's
  earnings to provide a more accurate picture of its financial performance for
  valuation purposes.


  The primary goal of addbacks is to give potential buyers and lenders a clear
  understanding of a business's true, ongoing profitability and cash flow. This
  is especially relevant when using a multiple of EBITDA (Earnings Before
  Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) to determine a company's
  market value.
