label: Corporate Expense (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric captures the total expense amounts generated from all
  expense-related accounts at the corporate level at budget rate, meaning the
  values are presented in their original currency without translation to a
  reporting currency. It represents the comprehensive view of operational costs
  incurred across the organization, including salaries, benefits, marketing,
  administrative costs, utilities, and other day-to-day expenditures, using the
  budgeted exchange rates or original transaction currency. This measurement is
  used for budget planning and variance analysis, helping organizations compare
  planned versus actual corporate expenses in their native currencies without
  the effects of currency conversion, supporting more accurate cost management
  and financial forecasting.
