label: Taxes (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the total tax expenses incurred by the organization at
  budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their original currency
  without translation to a reporting currency. It represents all tax obligations
  including income taxes, corporate taxes, and other tax liabilities related to
  business operations, using the budgeted exchange rates or original transaction
  currency. This measurement is used for budget planning and variance analysis,
  helping organizations compare planned versus actual tax expenses in their
  native currencies without the effects of currency conversion, supporting more
  accurate tax planning, forecasting, and financial strategy development across
  different jurisdictions and markets.
