label: BU Owned Expense (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric captures the total expense amounts generated from all
  asset-related accounts that are owned and managed by specific business units
  at budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their original currency
  without translation to a reporting currency. It represents the financial
  impact of asset transactions, including depreciation, amortization,
  impairments, and other asset-related expenses that are attributed to business
  unit operations, using the budgeted exchange rates or original transaction
  currency. This measurement is used for budget planning and variance analysis,
  helping organizations track and compare planned versus actual asset-driven
  expenses at the business unit level in their native currencies without the
  effects of currency conversion.
