label: Depreciation (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the depreciation expense for tangible fixed assets at
  budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their original currency
  without translation to a reporting currency. It represents the systematic
  allocation of costs associated with physical assets such as buildings,
  machinery, equipment, vehicles, and furniture over their useful lives, using
  the budgeted exchange rates or original transaction currency. This measurement
  is used for budget planning and variance analysis, helping organizations
  compare planned versus actual depreciation expenses in their native currencies
  without the effects of currency conversion, supporting more accurate capital
  planning and asset management decisions.
