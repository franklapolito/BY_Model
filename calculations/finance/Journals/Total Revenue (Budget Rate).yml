label: Revenue (Budget Rate)
description: >
  This metric tracks the total revenue generated by the organization from all
  sources at budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their original
  currency without translation to a reporting currency. It represents the
  complete inflow of economic benefits from ordinary business activities such as
  sales of goods, provision of services, licensing fees, and other
  income-generating operations, using the budgeted exchange rates or original
  transaction currency. This measurement is used for budget planning and
  variance analysis, helping organizations compare planned versus actual revenue
  performance in their native currencies without the effects of currency
  conversion, supporting more accurate sales forecasting, performance
  evaluation, and strategic planning across different markets and regions.
