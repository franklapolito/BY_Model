label: Amortization for Intangibles (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the amortization expense for intangible assets at budget
  rate, meaning the values are presented in their original currency without
  translation to a reporting currency. It represents the systematic allocation
  of costs associated with non-physical assets such as patents, trademarks,
  customer relationships, and other intellectual property over their useful
  lives, using the budgeted exchange rates or original transaction currency.
  This measurement is used for budget planning and variance analysis, helping
  organizations compare planned versus actual amortization expenses for
  intangible assets in their native currencies without the effects of currency
  conversion.
