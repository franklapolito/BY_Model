label: Interest Expense For Asset-Related Accounts (As Reported)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the interest expense specifically associated with
  asset-related financing, representing the borrowing costs tied to the
  acquisition, construction, or development of specific assets. It captures
  interest charges on loans, credit facilities, or other financing arrangements
  that are directly attributable to particular assets, such as equipment
  financing, real estate mortgages, or construction loans where the borrowing is
  linked to a specific capital investment. This measurement is used for
  financial reporting purposes to show the as-reported figures for
  asset-specific interest costs, helping organizations distinguish between
  general operating debt expenses and financing costs tied to particular
  investments, supporting more accurate cost allocation and asset valuation
  decisions.
