description: >-
  This metric tracks the interest expense incurred by the business for borrowed
  funds, representing the cost of debt financing from loans, bonds, credit
  facilities, and other borrowing arrangements. It captures the amounts paid to
  lenders and creditors for the use of capital, including interest charges and
  related fees, while excluding interest associated with asset-specific
  financing. This measurement is used for financial reporting purposes to show
  the as-reported figures for interest costs, helping organizations understand
  their financing expenses, evaluate the cost of their capital structure, assess
  debt service requirements, and support decisions around borrowing strategies
  and capital allocation.
