label: Interest Expense Fee (As Reported)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the fees and charges associated with interest expenses and
  their amortization over time, representing the additional costs beyond base
  interest rates that businesses incur when borrowing funds. It captures
  expenses such as loan origination fees, facility fees, commitment fees, and
  the systematic amortization of upfront borrowing costs that are spread over
  the life of the debt. This measurement is used for financial reporting
  purposes to show the as-reported figures for interest-related fees, helping
  organizations understand the total cost of debt financing beyond simple
  interest payments and support more comprehensive analysis of borrowing
  efficiency and capital structure decisions.
