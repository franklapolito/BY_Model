label: Amortization for Intangibles (As Reported)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the amortization expense for intangible assets,
  representing the systematic allocation of costs associated with non-physical
  assets such as patents, trademarks, customer relationships, and other
  intellectual property over their useful lives. It captures the non-cash
  expense that reflects how the value of these intangible assets is gradually
  recognized over time in the financial statements. This measurement is used for
  financial reporting purposes to show the as-reported figures for intangible
  asset amortization, helping organizations understand the financial impact of
  their intangible investments and meet accounting requirements for non-physical
  asset depreciation.
