description: >
  This metric represents the bottom-line profitability of the organization at
  budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their original currency
  without translation to a reporting currency. It calculates total revenues
  minus all expenses, including operating costs, interest, taxes, depreciation,
  and amortization, using the budgeted exchange rates or original transaction
  currency. This measurement is used for budget planning and variance analysis,
  helping organizations compare planned versus actual net earnings in their
  native currencies without the effects of currency conversion, supporting more
  accurate performance evaluation, forecasting, and strategic planning across
  different markets and regions.
