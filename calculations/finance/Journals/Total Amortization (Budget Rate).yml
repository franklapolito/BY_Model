label: Total Amortization (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the total amortization expense across all intangible assets
  at budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their original currency
  without translation to a reporting currency. It combines the systematic
  allocation of costs for both acquired software technology and other intangible
  assets such as patents, trademarks, and customer relationships, using the
  budgeted exchange rates or original transaction currency. This measurement is
  used for budget planning and variance analysis, helping organizations compare
  planned versus actual amortization expenses for all intangible assets in their
  native currencies without the effects of currency conversion, supporting more
  accurate cost management and strategic planning for intangible asset
  investments.
