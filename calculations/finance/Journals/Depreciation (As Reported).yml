label: Depreciation (As Reported)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the depreciation expense for tangible fixed assets,
  representing the systematic allocation of costs associated with physical
  assets such as buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, and furniture over
  their useful lives. It captures the non-cash expense that reflects how the
  value of these physical assets decreases over time due to wear and tear,
  obsolescence, or age. This measurement is used for financial reporting
  purposes to show the as-reported figures for depreciation, helping
  organizations understand the financial impact of their capital investments,
  meet accounting requirements for asset valuation, and support decision-making
  around asset replacement and maintenance strategies.
