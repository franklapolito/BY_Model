label: Amortization for Acquired Software Technology (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the amortization expense for acquired software technology
  assets at budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their original
  currency without translation to a reporting currency. It represents the
  systematic allocation of costs associated with purchased or acquired software
  over its useful life, using the budgeted exchange rates or original
  transaction currency. This measurement is used for budget planning and
  variance analysis, helping organizations compare planned versus actual
  amortization expenses in their native currencies and understand the financial
  impact of their technology investments without the effects of currency
  conversion.
