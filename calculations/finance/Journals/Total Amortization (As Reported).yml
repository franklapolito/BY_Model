label: Total Amortization (As Reported)
description: >-
  This metric tracks the total amortization expense across all intangible
  assets, combining the systematic allocation of costs for both acquired
  software technology and other intangible assets such as patents, trademarks,
  and customer relationships. It represents the comprehensive non-cash expense
  that reflects how the value of all intangible assets is gradually recognized
  over their useful lives in the financial statements. This measurement is used
  for financial reporting purposes to show the as-reported figures for total
  amortization, helping organizations understand the overall impact of
  intangible asset investments on profitability, support financial analysis and
  valuation, and meet accounting requirements for intangible asset depreciation
  across all categories.
