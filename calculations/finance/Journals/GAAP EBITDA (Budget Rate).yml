label: GAAP EBITDA (Budget Rate)
description: >-
  This metric calculates Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and
  Amortization (EBITDA) in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
  Principles (GAAP) at budget rate, meaning the values are presented in their
  original currency without translation to a reporting currency. It represents a
  measure of operating performance that adds back non-cash expenses like
  depreciation and amortization, as well as taxes, using the budgeted exchange
  rates or original transaction currency. This measurement is used for budget
  planning and variance analysis, helping organizations compare planned versus
  actual operational efficiency in their native currencies without the effects
  of currency conversion, supporting more accurate performance evaluation and
  strategic decision-making across different markets and regions.
